The next step of developments requires that I have to write an OS in RISC-V
assembly to build a foundational understanding of how the verifier and
compilation process should work.

So since this is quite a big single block of work and I also have another
personal project, progress has stalled for a bit.

I will get back to this when either:
- I get blocked, frustrated or largely finish my other personal project.
- I get frustrated with what ever programming language I'm using.
